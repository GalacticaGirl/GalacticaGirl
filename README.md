GalacticaGirl

👋 Hi, I'm @GalacticaGirl, a new coding astronaut exploring the galaxy of code! 🚀

👀 I'm interested in:
- Building futuristic applications that defy gravity
- Harnessing the power of code and collaboration to make the universe a better place
- Unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos through data analysis

🌱 I'm currently learning:
- Python Webscraping
- Enrolled in short course learning Java and systems development as whole.
- Machine Learning (it's like quantum physics, but cooler!)
- How to code with my eyes closed (just kidding... or am I?)

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on:
- A project that combines space exploration and social impact
- A revolutionary new programming language that's out of this world
- A hackathon to save the world (or at least the galaxy)

📫 How to reach me:
- Email: happyness.sokolangani@gmail.com
- Galactic Positioning System (GPS): 43.2134° N, 72.3456° W
- Telepathy (just kidding, or am I?)

😄 Pronouns: Galactic/Gal/

⚡ Fun fact: I once wrote a program that accidentally created a black hole in my code editor. True story! (Just kidding... or am I?)

Feel free to reach out and let's code the universe together! 💫
